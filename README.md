- 👋 Hi, I’m @itsjustbert
- 👀 I’m interested in E-Sports (playing/watching) cooking and movies in my free time but recently have stopped almost everything to learn coding. I started with a book by
- Daniel Shiffman called Learning Processing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in harvards free computer science class through edX CS50. I also am going through freecodecamp, which I 
- really am enjoying. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...Not really sure yet, set this up for my future and we will see what comes :D
- 📫 How to reach me ...
